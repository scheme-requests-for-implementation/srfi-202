<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The SRFI-2 library introduced the <code>and-let*</code> form
  for short-circuited evaluation in the style of the <code>and</code>
  form with the ability to capture the (non-<code>#f</code>) results
  in the style of the <code>let*</code> form. This document extends
  the <code>and-let*</code> form with the abilities to pattern-match
  (or "destructurally bind") the values of evaluated expressions
  (where the match failure causes short-circuiting rather than
  raising an error), and to handle multiple values (where only the
  falsehood of the first value causes short-circuiting).
</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

None at present.

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>It is well known that, in the context of the <code>if</code> condition,
  Scheme treats <code>#f</code> as a <i>false</i> value, and every other value
  is considered true (or "true-ish").</p>

<p>This design decision has led to the development of the idiom in which the
  <code>#f</code> is considered to represent "the absence of value" or a "failure
  of computation", whereas any other value is considered to represent a meaningful
  result.</p>

<p>In strongly typed languages, this pattern is usually expressed in terms of algebraic
  data types. For example, the Haskell language defines the polymorphic type
  <code>Maybe a</code> as either <code>Just a</code> or <code>Nothing</code>,
  where <code>Just a</code> is used to represent a value of type <code>a</code>,
  and <code>Nothing</code> is used to represent the absence of value.</p>

<p>Moreover, in many functional languages, the types isomorphic to <code>Maybe</code>
  are considered to be "monads", which means that they can use some facilities
  that those languages provide for sequencing functions that return things that
  are considered to be "monads". In particular, Haskell provides a special syntactic
  form called the <code>do</code> notation, which allows the function like</p>

<pre>
  h x = case (f x) of
          Just y -> case (g (k y)) of
                      Just z -> Just (l z)
                      Nothing -> Nothing
          Nothing -> Nothing
</pre>

to be rewritten as

<pre>
  h x = do
    y &lt;- (f x)
    z &lt;- (g (k y))
    return (l z)
</pre>

<p>where <code>f</code> and <code>g</code> (and <code>h</code>) return
  optional values, and <code>k</code> and <code>l</code> return obligatory
  values.</p>

<p>Since these facilities rely on some advanced features of type systems
  that are lacking from most Scheme implementations, Schemers have invented
  a special form specifically for dealing with optional values. The form
  is called <code>and-let*</code> and has been defined in the SRFI-2 document.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the equivalent code using Scheme can be written as</p>

<pre>
  (define (h x)
    (and-let* ((y (f x))
               (z (g (k y))))
      (l z)))
</pre>

<p>However, the original definition of <code>and-let*</code> does not allow
  one to handle multiple values. It also doesn't allow one to destructure the value
  of the evaluated expression. The purpose of this SRFI is to extend the
  <code>and-let*</code> form with these capabilities.</p>

<p>Therefore, with the capabilities from this SRFI, the two first examples
  from the Rationale section of SRFI 2, namely:</p>

<pre>
  (and-let* ((my-list (compute-list))
             ((pair? my-list)))
    (do-something my-list))

  (define (lookup key alist)
    (and-let* ((x (assq key alist))
               ((pair? x)))
      (cdr x)))
</pre>

<p>could roughly be rewritten as:</p>

<pre>
  (and-let* ((`(,my . ,list) (compute-list)))
    (do-something `(,my . ,list)))

  (define (lookup key alist)
    (and-let* ((`(,key . ,value) (assq key alist)))
      key))
</pre>

<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>The extensions provided here do not invalidate or modify any of the prior
  uses of the SRFI 2's <code>and-let*</code> form.</p>

<p>In particular, the <code>and-let*</code> form allowed two types of expressions
  inside of its "claws":</p>

<pre>(variable expression)</pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre>(guard-expression)</pre>

<p>This SRFI document allows <code>variable</code> to be an arbitrary
  pattern that is a valid pattern of the underlying pattern matcher
  (see <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-200/">SRFI 200</a>
  Pattern Matching for more details):</p>

<pre>(pattern expression)</pre>

<p>In particular, since patterns can be literal values, it is possible
  to negate the condition:</p>

<pre>
  (and-let*  ((my-list (compute-list))
              (#f (null? my-list)))
    (do-something my-list))
</pre>

<p>If the value of an expression does not match the pattern, then the
  value of the whole <code>and-let*</code> form is <code>#f</code>.<p>

<p>This variant of the <code>and-let*</code> form also supports multiple
  values, each of which can be a pattern:</p>

<pre>(pattern patterns ... expression)</pre>

<p>If the first <code>pattern</code> is a variable, then it must have
  a non-<code>#f</code> value in order to proceed with evaluation
  &mdash; otherwise, the value of the whole <code>and-let*</code> form
  becomes <code>#f</code>.</p>

<p>If the <code>expression</code> returns fewer values than expected,
  then the value of the whole <code>and-let*</code> expression becomes
  <code>#f</code>. If it returns more values than expected, then the
  additional values are ignored.</p>

<p>In addition, following SRFI-71 and SRFI-201 - the
  extension proposed here supports the <code>values</code>
  keyword specially, allowing one to capture "the remaining
  values" in a list - for example, the claws of form
</p>

<pre>((<b>values</b> p1 p2 . v*) expression)</pre>

<p>(where <code><b>values</b></code> is to be treated as a
  literal symbol) requires that
  <code>expression</code> returns at least two values;
  the first two will be bound to patterns <code>p1</code>
  and <code>p2</code> (if they match), and the
  remaining values, if present, will be captured
  in a list <code>v*</code>.
</p>

<p>If the <code>expression</code> returns (in this case)
  less than two values, then the whole
  <code>and-let*</code> form short-circuits to
  <code>#f</code>.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

  (lambda (stx)
    (syntax-case stx (values)

      ((_ () body ...)
       #'(let () body ...))

       #'(let ((name binding))
	   (and name
		(and-let* (rest ...)
	           body ...))))

      ((_ (((values . structure) expression) rest ...)
          body ...)
       #'(call-with-values (lambda () expression)
	   (lambda args

	   (lambda args
	     (match args
	       ((value * ... . _)
		(and value
		     (and-let* (rest ...)
		       body ...)))
	       (_ #f)))))

      ((_ ((value ... expression) rest ...) body ...)
       #'(call-with-values (lambda () expression)
	   (lambda args
	     (match args
	       ((value ... . _)
		(and-let* (rest ...)
		  body ...))
	       (_ #f)))))

<p>The repository for this SRFI contains an implementation
  for <a href="https://github.com/panicz/srfi-202/blob/draft-2/guile/srfi/srfi-202.scm">Guile</a> built on top of the
  <code>(ice-9 match)</code> module a.k.a.
  Wright-Cartwright-Shinn matcher, and an implementation
  for <a href="https://github.com/panicz/srfi-202/blob/draft-2/racket/srfi/202.rkt">Racket</a>, built on top of Racket's
  <code>racket/match</code> module. A suite of
  testable examples is available for both
  <a href="https://github.com/panicz/srfi-202/blob/draft-2/guile/examples.scm">Guile</a> and <a href="https://github.com/panicz/srfi-202/blob/draft-2/racket/examples.rkt">Racket</a>.</p>


<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>The original <code>and-let*</code> form was conceived
  by Oleg Kiselyov, who owes the credit for both the
  idea and the name. It was one of the earliest documents
  described within the SRFI process, as it received
  the number 2.</p>

<p>The editor of this SRFI turned out to be a real
  Schemer, and when I asked him if it would be possible
  to make sure that it gets the number 202, he said he
  would do his best (I'm sorry for turning you in,
  Arthur).</p>

<p>This SRFI owes the support for <code>values</code>
  keyword to Marc Nieper Wißkirchen, who pointed out
  the limitations of the original solution that
  I initially proposed. Marc's remarks about backward
  compatibility also helped to improve this text.</p>

<p>The technique of pattern matching on data structures
  was brought to Scheme by Andrew K. Wright and Robert
  Cartwright through Alex Shinn's implementation, that was
  distributed with many implementations of Scheme.</p>

<p>My first contact with Scheme was through Guile,
  which is a part of the GNU project. I found Guile
  to have exceptionally good documentation, optimized
  for people who spend their lives in VT100 terminal
  emulators. The maintainers of Guile at that time were
  Neil Jerram, Ludovic Courtes, Andy Wingo and
  Mark Weaver.</p>

<p>The person responsible for convincing me that
  it makes sense to express my ideas and developments
  regarding Scheme in the form of SRFI documents is
  John Cowan.</p>
